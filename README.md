# Autonomous Car Deep Learning Project

In this project, I trained a virtual car to drive around various tracks. I created three different models: A transformer planner, based on the Perceiver architecture, a convolutional neural network planner, and a multilayer perceptron planner.


## Watch the car drive!

You can see how the car drives by navigating to the [videos](https://github.com/ryanxshah/self-driving-car/tree/main/videos) folder and downloading the videos of interest.

There are 4 videos for each model, the transformer planner and the multilayer perceptron planner. Each video corresponds to a different track.
