# Self Driving Car Deep Learning Project

In this project, I trained a virtual car to drive around various tracks. I created three different models: A transformer planner, based on the Perceiver architecture, a convolutional neural network planner, and a multilayer perceptron planner.


## Watch the car drive!

You can see how the car drives by navigating to the [Videos](https://github.com/ryanxshah/self-driving-car/tree/main/videos) folder.
